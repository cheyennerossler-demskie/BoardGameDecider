# BoardGameDecider
---
## Concept:
A web application called Board Game Decider that hosts a diverse collection of board games, offering detailed specifications for each game, including player count, estimated length of play time, age range, and type of game. The intended purpose of Board Game Decider is to streamline the process of selecting a board game(s) to play, providing clear criteria for each game.

## Inspiration:
Drawing inspiration from the functionality of websites like https://boardgamegeek.com/.

## Functionality:
Upon entering Board Game Decider, users will be prompted with various search options for finding board games, including filtering by player count, estimated length of play time, age range, or game type. Then, based on their search type, users will further refine their search by specifying minimum and maximum parameters for player count, play length, and age range, as well as which genre of game. After submitting their criteria, the application queries its database and presents a list of relevant results of board games to the user. Once users are notified of the results, whether an applicable board game(s) is found or not, they are given the option to be navigated back to the start-page of Board Game Decider to follow the same sequence of prompts. 

TO BE ADDED: Each board game listing includes an image, detailed specifications, and an additional description of its theme. 

## Technological Resources:
Board Game Decider utilizes an SQL database to store board game information, enabling efficient updates for new additions or removals. The backend is developed using HTML, JavaScript, and JQuery, while W3.CSS ensures a responsive frontend design. 

TO BE ADDED: Additionally, the integration of an API may be employed to facilitate the retrieval of high-quality images of each board game.
